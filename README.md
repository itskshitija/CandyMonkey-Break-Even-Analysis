## üìåIntroduction
CandyMonkey, a local confectionery brand in Raipur, is launching a new chocolate product called the Mini Pack. This chocolate is expected to appeal to both children and families seeking delightful chocolate treats. The company has conducted a market study and has generated reliable sales forecasts. They have already developed samples and know the proportion of different raw materials that will be used. You have been provided with the following information by the company and have been asked to conduct a break-even analysis for CandyMonkey‚Äôs new product. This involves estimating the sales required to cover all costs, taking into account sales forecasts, variable costs, and fixed costs. They plan to launch this product on January 1st, 2024.

## üöÄObjective
Create a financial model covering the first twelve months to perform a break-even analysis for CandyMonkey's Mini Pack chocolates. Utilize the provided sales forecasts, variable costs, and fixed costs, and assess how different factors could influence profitability.

## üìçBusiness Case
A CandyMonkey company wants to overhaul their business strategy, To do so the management team has requested these specific details:
- **Develop a financial model to perform a break-even analysis for the Mini Pack.**
- **Estimate the sales volume required to cover fixed and variable costs over the first twelve months.**
- **Evaluate the impact of changes in key variables (e.g., pricing, costs, sales growth) on profitability.**
- **Provide insights to guide strategic decisions related to pricing, production, and marketing.**

## üìúRequirement Gathering and Documentation
As a business analyst, the first step would be to gather all the requirements necessary for the analysis and document it.
Documentation is the most critical part of project development as it is the foundation of all further project deliverables describing what inputs and outputs are associated with each process function.

### I have created a Business Requirement documentation for our business case [Here](https://github.com/itskshitija/CandyMonkey-Break-Even-Analysis/blob/main/CandyMonkey_BRD.pdf)

#### The Cost of Material per Unit is calculated by dividing the Total Cost of Raw Materials by the Total Sales Quantity (in units) for the respective month. 
```
Cost¬†of¬†Material¬†per¬†Unit = Sales¬†Quantity¬†(units) √∑ Total¬†Cost¬†of¬†Raw¬†Materials¬†(Rs)
```
The cost of raw materials is increasing after March due to the 10% month-on-month growth in sales quantity starting from April. As the sales quantity increases, the total amount of raw materials required also increases, directly impacting the cost.

## Contribution Analysis
#### Breakdown of Contribution:
- **Sales:** Total revenue generated from selling Mini Packs.
- **Variable Cost:** Total cost of materials and labor (changes based on sales volume).
- **Contribution:** The profit remaining after deducting variable costs, which contributes to covering fixed costs and generating profit.
  
```
Contribution = Sales - Variable Cost
```
| Month        | Sales (‚Çπ) | Material Cost (‚Çπ) | Labour Cost (‚Çπ) | Total Variable Cost (‚Çπ) | Contribution (‚Çπ) | Contribution per Unit (‚Çπ) |

#### Observation
- The Contribution per Unit (‚Çπ80.25) remains consistent across all months because the sales price per unit (‚Çπ140) and the material cost per unit (‚Çπ49.75) are constant.
- Any increase in total contribution is due to the growth in sales quantity from April onwards.

## Break-Even Analysis
Break-Even Analysis is a financial calculation used to determine the point at which total revenue equals total costs (both fixed and variable), resulting in neither profit nor loss. This point is known as the break-even point (BEP). It helps businesses understand how many units of a product or service they need to sell to cover their costs.

#### **Negative Profits (January to August):**
- From January to August, the profits remain negative, reflecting that the business's Contribution was insufficient to cover the Fixed Expenses (Factory Rent, Administration Costs, and Marketing Costs).
- This indicates that the business had not yet reached its break-even point ‚Äî the point where Total Contribution = Total Fixed Expenses, and profits become zero.

#### Transition to Positive Profits (September Onwards):
- From September onwards, profits turn positive, showing that the business has successfully surpassed its break-even point.
- This change implies that the cumulative increase in contribution margin from growing revenue has finally covered all fixed costs, and the business is now generating surplus profits.

#### Break-Even Analysis
- The negative profits until August indicate that the business was operating below the break-even point.
- The positive profits from September onwards signify that the business has crossed the break-even threshold, and every additional contribution is directly adding to profits.

The primary driver of achieving the break-even point here is the incremental increase in contribution margin due to increased sales revenue over the months.
